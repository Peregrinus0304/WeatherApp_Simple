# WeatherApp_Simple
Classic mobile weather application. I used free OpenWeather API with option to look for a weather for the specified coordinates and get current weather and hourly/daily forecast.

 - use extension for GIF animations
 - use Google autocomplete search with Google Places API
 - use UI animations
